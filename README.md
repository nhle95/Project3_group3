Project Description/Outline
We are creating the webpage that displayed covid-data from multiple sources. The main page contains the tracker, dashboard, map, and contact us. Our webpage provides the number of covid-confirmed and death for each country. We also provide the story of the coronavirus and how to protect ourself from the covid. At the end, we are using leaflet to create a heat map to better visualize the volume of locations/events within a dataset.
